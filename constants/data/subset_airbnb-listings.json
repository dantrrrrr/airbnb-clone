I'll send you a welcome note a couple days before the start of your booking that should have all the details you'll need (re locating the key pick-up, my apartment, Wifi codes, local amenities, tips on using the shared spaces).  CHECK-IN:  Weekdays: I can usually personally greet and orient you after 7 PM (or before 6AM).

Also since I'm in the culinary industry I'd be happy to suggest and get reservations for you at various restaurants all over the city. If you would like for me to help put together an itinerary, I work with a local hotel concierge that can be of assistance in making your trip fun filled and entertaining.  As NYC is a melting pot, I have friends of different ethnicity that can help translate and maybe even show you around as well. Let me know in advance and I'd be happy to set something up.",

Currently I do a little food writing and plan on becoming a food critic in the near future as I love to dine all over the city. \r\n I would say that I am a citizen of the world. I have been to over 20 countries and plan to reach my goal of 100 countries in the next 20 yrs. Wish me luck. Out of some of those countries I have resided for long periods of time in Belize, Central America; Mexico; and the Bahamas in the Caribbean. I hope to one day live in South East Asia, preferably Cambodia as they are big in the volunteerism industry. Actually for the last few years I have been residing in Belize volunteering and traveling throughout Central America. \r\n  I speak a few languages, which include French Spanish and obviously English. I'm really not so good at the second languages but I get by and I could probably hold a good intense 10 minute conversation before you tell me to just stop trying.. lol.\r\n  I am big on anthropology and love to meet new people and find out about they're cultures and experiences. I guess I would say that I am a big people person. I love the whole concept of Airbnb because it allows me to do what I love best... travel and socialize. As a host I understand what its like to visit new or even revisit interesting places and so I like to be as accommodating to my guest as much as possible.\r\n  I think that's pretty much it about me. Oh no wait, I also have a pretty good sense of humor.  \" knock knock\" ... \"who's there?\" ... \"you're airbnb guest!\" Ok maybe not so funny but I try.",

I recently started a new business with my partner and I will be transitioning to Miami this winter.\r\nIn the meantime, I'm just want to finish out some business here in the city and will be going back and forth. \r\nMy roommate is Simba, a short hair domestic kitty...actually, he owns the place, I just live here. Ha ha (I'm only half kidding).\r\nI'm very sensitive with my space, so I'm looking for artist, students of life, centered good-vibe folks who are coming to the city to explore their inner creativity. We have a kitchen, washer and dryer in the basement and we are in the upper most part of Manhattan. So you can enjoy the city, but still escape to a little nook that is walking distance from Inwood Hill Park and the Hudson River.",

I rented at the Palms several times and fell in love with the property but was never that happy with the units I rented I think because I usually got carpeted units which I dislike and the entertainment features were old fashioned and I love to spend my evenings at home cooking and enjoying good movie. I am a Hairstylist and photographer in NYC and have a love for the right lighting so you allways look your best. Peter Lik is a photgrapher that has inspired me to capture beautiful landscapes and I print the on fujiflexchrome crystal archive paper which is light sensitive which is why I have everyting on dimmers. I also want to say that living in NYC I am exposed to the latest trends and styles. I love hotels like the W because they have a modern but simple way of making life feel new and refreshing and the old hawaiian style with wicker, floral prints and old hawaiian art is just so last decade I needed to go contemporary. With 2 nonstop flights to Honolulu from NYC I can ony hope that my style will enspire you to stay with me.",

I'm honest and respectful. I love walking about the city to take in the sights and eat as much as possible.\n\nBut i was born and raised in Houston Tx! Yup... I have cowboy boots and I can lasso. But I love the city of Houston! We are known for our quick wit and southern hospitality. The people I usually travel with are also from Houston! We love seeing new places and experiencing as much as possible. All my friends are good people doing the right things, so it's nice to break away from life and let loose! \n\nThanks! \nV",

You\u2019ll be just a few blocks away from some of New York\u2019s most famous attractions including Brooklyn Bridge and Union Square Park. Times Square and Grand Central are a short walk or cab ride away, and John F. Kennedy airport is within easy driving distance.",
    "notes": "Because many people ask: 1. Payment- You \u201csubmit a booking\u201d which means you pay the full amount now. I do not get paid until after your arrival. There are no cash transactions, and unfortunately you may not put down a cash deposit. Airbnb does not charge or authorize the security deposit unless there is a claim made against it after your stay. 2. The home comes with linens, towels, soaps, etc. 3. I can not send you any more pictures. 4. The site blocks telephone numbers so please do not send me your number and ask me to call you.",
    "transit": "Everything is within walking distance from the apartment. Taxis are plentiful and I recommend using Uber which runs 24/7. The nearest train and bus lines are an easy walk away.",
    "access": "Guests have access to everything in the home.",
    "interaction": "You will receive an email shortly after booking on how to check-in, including Wi-Fi and all other pertinent details. You will not hear from me again after check-in unless you need me.",
    "house_rules": "Please treat the home like you would treat your own home. Parties, lack of decorum and disruptive noise will not be tolerated. I encourage you to enjoy my space, however if noise or neighbor complaints are reported you will forfeit your entire deposit. It is important to respect the neighbors. Because the city of New York doesn't love Airbnb :( could you please simply say you are friends of the owner if anyone ever asked- which no one ever should.",

There will typically be a model in the studio during this time. If you'd like, we can also organize a NYC photoshoot to commemorate your stay. :-) Guests will have access to their own room, bathroom, and kitchen. I will be available for advice on things to see and do in the area vi",

There is a good mix of national brand stores for when you know exactly what you want and small boutique shops for when you want something unique. Curry Hill is a block to the east, with great Indian food and groceries... Eataly is a block to the west, with everything under the sun... and tons of great gourmet restaurants nearby. Not to mention the original Shake Shack. And Dover Street NY, for the fashionistas.",

The bathroom is small but sweet. There is a projector available that will connect to your laptop if you feel like staying in for a movie night. I'",

    "neighborhood_overview": "I love this area of New York and am always happy to give recommendations about places to eat, drink, things to do depending on what it is you're looking for. There is a police precinct across the street that makes the street feel very safe. The street has very little traffic at night and is very quiet (especially by New York standards!)",
    "notes": "Please turn the heat and lights off when you leave. It only takes a few minutes to heat the place up when you get home and it will save resources and the planet! The apartment is 3 flights up (44 steps). But totally worth it! *Also - please note - this apartment is technically a share. There are separate entrances and you will have total privacy but it is one large unit broken into two parts where I live in the other part.",
    "transit": "The apartment is in a perfect location. 5 min walk from the Lower East Side, Nolita, Little Italy. 10 min walk to Tribeca, East Village and Financial District. A short walk to all major subways (express stops) and a couple blocks away from a few citibike docks. You can always get a cab or uber in a few minutes too.",

From LGA, take the Q70 LTD bus (i.e., the express bus to Roosevelt St). At Roosevelt, transfer to the E subway toward Manhattan (total cost 2.50). From JFK, take the AirTrain to Jamaica Station. Transfer to the E subway toward Manhattan (total cost 7.50). From EWR, take the AirTrain to the airport train depot. Transfer to the NJ Rail to Manhattan's Penn Station (total cost app. 13.00 per person). Then, take the E subway downtown one stop, or take a taxi to our home. You can also walk from Penn Station if the weather is nice. From the E subway train, exit at 23 Street station in Manhattan. Walk two blocks to Tenth Ave. We live near the northwest corner of Tenth Ave and 23 St.",

No entertaining outside guests, smoking, or playing loud music. The use of illicit drugs is strictly forbidden. Use of the clothes washer is available with our supervision and at a cost of 7 per load (regretfully, we found this measure necessary after our machine was accidentally broken by a guest). Our building has stairs and is therefore not suitable for small children.",

Traveling to world capitals and exotic places is our passion: I speak French and Portuguese fluently, and Ed speaks Spanish.

Trendy restaurants of all kinds are punctuated by local ethnic cuisine alongside a new Starbucks; the same for the music, dancing, clubbing and the hooka craze! The public library, schools, playgrounds and numerous parks tempers the night life, but this is a bustling neighborhood with plenty to do. Fort Tryon Park and other local parks offer hiking, biking and amazing views of the Hudson River (only 3 blocks away). Atop the mountain is the Cloisters and  the New Leaf Cafe with spectacular panoramic views; hard to believe you are still in NYC! The locals are colorful and festive; the famous Marina Restaurant brings in celebrities and music, but 'restaurant row' along Dyckman is also what makes dining and entertainment exciting in this charming neighborhood. This is a neighborhood to 'experience'. The 24 hour grocery across the street saves the day...",

A second subway line is only 4 blocks away. Time Square is about 20 minutes, lower Manhattan in 30. Located at the upper tip of Manhattan Island where the East and West side are closest together means getting to the airports is super easy and bypasses mid-town traffic; a recent late night pick up at LaGuardia clocked in at 20 minutes each way! Newark is a straight shot over the George Washington Bridge, about 40 minutes. Local cabs and car services are readily available.",

We do not like to disturb the tenants with loud noise, late night music or other things that would disturb any neighbors.  The apartment is cleaned thoroughly after each visit and checked for nasty things like bedbugs (necessary these days) but we require a security deposit in case of property damage aside from normal 'wear and tear'.  Food garbage must be handled properly and removed frequently. We have no bugs or mice and hope to keep it that way with  your assistance!",

There are only a few rules: It is a 24/7 doorman building, and while I will of course register your names for full access,  I can unfortunately not allow additional guests as it would require me to personally contact the front desk each time.  TV and music if of course allowed, but please respect the neighbors by keeping the volume down. The bedroom closet is empty and for you to use. While I will have belongings in the hallways closet, there is a washer and dryer there that you can use. The master bedroom will be ready, with clean sheets on the bed. The second bed, which is a pullout couch in the living room, will have textile bags next to it with all the sheets, pillows, and cover. It is very easy to unfold the bed. There will be clean beige towels under the bathroom sink for you to use. The only thing I ask of you when you leave is to leave bedding and towels on the floor by the washer and dryer as an indicator for the cleaners to wash it",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Inwood is friendly, leafy-green, and community oriented. We have a wonderful Saturday Farmer's Market, the famous medieval museum at the Cloisters, views of the Hudson, and plenty of low key local bars and restaurants. You can also visit the spot where the island was first bought nearby. We call it Upstate Manhattan!",
    "notes": "This is a great location for parents or friends coming to visit students at Columbia or Fordham. Fordham is a 20 minute bus ride away on the Bx12, and Columbia is 20 minutes on the 1. My family loves being able to stay with me in Manhattan, and we all love the easy commute to school events. For the convenience and price it's a win-win.  Otherwise, the thing to note about Inwood is that it's 30 minutes to midtown and about 40 minutes all the way downtown, so if you're visiting NYC keep in mind that it's easy enough to get everywhere, but you won't be in and out of the house in between site-seeing destinations.  My apartment is an older building, and in all older buildings there are quirks. I have consistent hot water and decent water pressure, but sometimes the shower takes a while to calibrate. The furnaces are all working, but sometimes they make noise. If that is the kind of thing that will bother you a lot, this is probably not the right place for you to stay.",
    "transit": "There is lots of great public transit. My apartment is a half city block from the A train (runs down Broadway on the west side), 3 blocks from the 1 train (runs downs 8th avenue on the east side), several Manhattan buses downtown, and the Bronx 12 (Bx12) Select Service Bus into the Bronx.",

    "house_rules": "I'm pretty easy going. Just have basic respect for my things (i.e.,) don't break them, don't spill on them). To avoid that I would appreciate having no food or dark beverages in the bedroom. Beer/wine is okay- enjoy the city!",

I'm from Chicago originally, and I am loving plugging into the beat of a new city. I'm currently working on my Ph.D in philosophy, so that's an interest, but I also love to travel, eat, and read non-philosophy. My favorite form of exercise is Ashtanga Yoga, my favorite food is everything, my favorite night out is comedy and drinks, jazz, or wine classes. I also like to study languages, so I'm currently learning French for my degree, and I spent my undergraduate years learning Arabic and traveling in North Africa and in the Middle East. If only Arabic wasn't so hard, I might have gotten better at it!\r\n\r\nI hope to make sure that your stay is comfortable and that you have everything that you need. If you would like to stick around the neighborhood to get the Inwood experience, then I'm happy to show you around. But if you're doing your own thing, then by all means do NYC your way.\r\n\r\nps- I don't have a solo picture of me that's recent, so I'm the one in the middle of my profile picture! There I'm in France waiting to see some Bastille Day fireworks last summer.",

There are several grocery stores within 2 or 3 blocks of where I live, and a 24 hour Rite Aid is nearby. I recommend the sports bar Coogan's, Irish bar Le Cheile, and Italian restaurant Saggio as the best places to hang out locally.

During your stay, I'll be sleeping in the living room on the couch. The couch is positioned so that it's facing the windows, away from rest of the apartment and away from the walkway from the bedroom to the kitchen. You're welcome to use the kitchen at any point during your stay. You have access to any and all dishes, glasses, and silverware, a kettle, pour-over coffee maker, a few varieties of tea, and regular and decaf coffee. The one bathroom in the apartment is right next to the bedroom, and getting to it does not require passing through the living room. I will provide soap, shampoo, and towels.",

I have been at this particular location for six years so it should be assumed that I am infatuated with my neighborhood.  I am usually working in strange places for long periods of time, or out on the streets trying to squeeze the city for all it's worth.  I do go to the gym quite a bit for health and vanity reasons, but mostly because I want to roll into 40yo with a decent situation lol.  I am an ex-record collector and music snob but have seriously lightened up since it became a full-time job of sorts. I just started dabbling in stand-up comedy because it terrifies me and also, why-not?  I live off the delicious food in my neighborhood and feed off the culture that is in abundance here.  I have turned myself into a person who chooses to see the positive before the negative as it is all too easy to turn into a cynical New Yorker.  I look forward to meeting you!\r\n\r\n\r\nAll best,\r\nEric",

Community gardens also adorn the neighborhood.  Home of the American Late-Night Comedy Show, The Daily Show, as well as countless Zagat-rated eateries and bistros, Hell\u2019s Kitchen is the best and brightest slice of New York City.",

On Foot: There are countless attractions just minutes away, including Broadway shows, Restaurant Row, Central Park, Hudson River Park and many more. NYC Subway: A five-minute walk to 47th Street & Broadway gets you access the N, Q and R trains. A three-minute walk to 46th Street & 8th Avenue gets you access to the A, C, E, 1,2,3, S and 7 trains.  On Bike: A one-minute walk to 45th Street & 8th Ave gets you access to NYC\u2019s Citi Bike, a great and affordable way to bike around town.  By Car: In addition to many NYC taxis, there are several affordable private car services that traffic this area. Chat with me upon your arrival to receive great discounts on Lyft, Uber, Via and Gett, to name a few of the affordable private car services available in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.",

It is because of this that I make myself readily available for my guests.  If you have any questions about getting around NYC, things to see, places to eat, concerts to catch, I am happy to spend some time helping you out and making suggestions.  The better you understand what is available to you, the better your stay! I am here to help!",

Let's leave the rodents in the NYC subways. - Refrain from bringing outside guests unless confirmed with your hosts. We are friendly, but want to keep our home safe. - Refrain from using recreational drugs or throwing parties. There are so many nearby bars to have a good time. - Keep the noise level down after midnight. Cinderella needs her beauty rest. - Turn off the air conditioner, television, light fixture and any other appliances before leaving the apartment. The environment will thank you for it.

Washington Heights is one of the few neighborhoods left in Manhattan with that real old New York feel - a wonderful multicultural mix of families, artists, kids, professionals, students, locals, and world travelers. My place is a hundred yards from stunning views of the George Washington bridge from Riverside Drive, on the edge of a genteel historic district called Audubon Terrace.

In other words I'll be around, and love helping, but you won't see too much of me.",

I went to college at FSU and was first a Music Performance Major (French Horn), but later switched to a Fashion Merchandising Major which is what I hold my bachelor's degree in. \r\n\r\nI have recently just relocated to New York City and currently reside in the Upper East Side. I work for a luxury jewelry company on Fifth Avenue. \r\n\r\nI am currently single and will most likely be traveling alone, at most with a friend. I am fairly shy and quiet at first but tend to open up fairly quickly. I don't go out to bars much, but love a good restaurant and will be on my priority list of things to do when am in your city. Am also a huge music and movie buff. \r\n\r\nNow that I am turning 30 this year I have decided to do more traveling and find that Airbnb might be the most affordable way to go places I have yet to see. I have never used this before but I am excited to try this out and hope it all works out.",

Because of its central location, new restaurants are opening all of the time, and the nightlife is picking up considerably.  The Ace Hotel is a block away, with the NoMad Hotel at the end of the block. Fairway Supermarket is 4 blocks away as well as the famed Eataly, and, if you love to shop, 5th Avenue shopping is down the street in the Flatiron district, as well as Macy's and Herald Square shopping in the opposite direction. Even Times Square is just a short subway ride (2 stops) or 20-minute walk away. You can stroll through Madison Square Square Park to view the lovely art installations or just people watch ... or head on over to the Highline to get a bird's eye view of the city landscape.  We're moving on up here!",

With longtime residents and first-generation hipsters welcoming a new wave of students and young professionals to the area, the diverse population continues to grow. The Lower East Side stretches east from the Bowery to the East River Park. It is bordered on the north by Houston Street and the south by Canal Street and East Broadway.",

The street is most alive at night - any hour of the night, so it's safe to walk around at almost any hour. Convenient parking on street and in garages nearby, Washington Square Park and Thompkins Square Parks are within easy walking distance, and both have off-leash dog areas that are fun.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "The building is in the heart of just about.... everything.  We are blocks away from: Central Park, Times Square, Hells Kitchen's restaurants, Restaurant Row, Columbus Circle, the Lincoln Center, Rockefeller Center and Radio City Hall, among other destinations.  All of Broadway's musicals are just feet away from the building's front entrance, and Hells Kitchen is literally just one avenue over.  Hells Kitchen is renowned for its dining experiences, and the plethora of restaurants that it has to offer.",

My preferred guests are those that simply want a comfortable place to come home to, and not the types that want to have people over. The following is not permitted: breaking glasses and/or kitchenware, consumption of any liquor and/or wine from the cabinet and/or bar, and smoking.",

I've lived downtown, gramercy park, and even stayed in the Upper East and West Side, and there is no place like the Village. You have everything you could need and more importantly everything you want! Steps from Union Square, a quick subway ride to anywhere and yet you could stay within five blocks of my apartment and not need anything else! Young, hip, and lively neighborhood with a weekend culture of the friends who brunch, and coffee house workaholics!",
    "notes": "This is a traditional walk-up apartment building, so if you are elderly, or need additional assistance, beware that there is no elevator! Also, with my building's age and construction comes NYC nuances: store your food properly, otherwise we will all have an issue, and no matter how many hours of cleaning we do, it will never be spotless. Please take these things into consideration before booking if these things will bother you!! All that I ask, is that you treat this like your home, because it should feel like your home too :) This is a quiet space to relax in the upbeat pace of New York City. Step out on to the streets and enjoy the city that never sleeps but come back to a cozy and calm place to recharge! Enjoy the craziness of NYC but please leave it out there when you return :)",

    "notes": "A quick note if you are considering adding the 3rd guest option to your stay. The bedroom accommodates two people. The sofa in the living room folds down to a bed (it's a very expensive and very comfortable sofa). We sometimes work late hours and when we arrive home we will enter through the living room to wash our hands and brush our teeth before we retire to our room. Our arrival time is usually anywhere between 12-1am (and on rare occasions perhaps 3am). We arrive quietly but the third person may still be woken up. Realistically, though, who goes to sleep before 1am in NYC? :) We have had guests stay in the living room and their experience was nothing but exceptional.",

The L train a highly sought after transportation means and will get you into union Square in Manhattan in 20 minutes. All other trains are easily accessible from the L train in Manhattan.

    "neighborhood_overview": "Harlem is known internationally as the Mecca of the African diaspora, but Harlem has been home to many different identities including the Dutch, Irish, German, Italian, and Jewish. Harlem was originally settled by the Dutch in 1658, but was largely farmland and undeveloped territory for approximately 200 years. As New York\u2019s population grew, residential and commercial expansion moved northward, and development of the Harlem territory was inevitable. During the 1880\u2019s, elevated rail lines were extended north along Eight & Ninth Avenues, encouraging expansion northward. Development of transportation lines caused speculation on the land and many fine row houses and multiple family apartment buildings were erected. However, this boom slowed in 1893 when a national recession struck. The recession curbed further developed and stymied real estate sales. When the economy recovered in 1895, development continued, especially in the form of beautiful apartment buildings. Located on 123rd street,",

If you want to avoid this issue entirely, there is a parking garage on 124th St directly one block north of our apartment.  Security - two doors at entrance to the apartment block lead into a corridor with bike storage, with third door (to the apartment) on the second floor.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Outside, you are two blocks from the start of the Williamsburg Bridge and a 5 minute walk to the JMZ or a 12 minute walk to the Bedford L.  So many great places in the neighborhood.  Our neighbors are Pies N' Thighs, Baby's All Right (music!), Donna, Briskettown, Marlowe & Sons and my favorite restaurant, Diner.   We'll provide a thorough list of the best bbq, cocktail bars and things to see in the neighborhood. Williamsburg is easily the hottest spot in NYC these days and changing by the month.   South Williamsburg still preserves a bit of the older neighborhood with Latino families, Hasidic Jewish neighborhoods and hipsters all converging.",

    "access": "My girlfriend and I are both travelers and treat our guests as we would want to be treated. Everything is modern and will be yours to use as if you live there.   We love to socialize when appropriate but also know when and to whom to give quiet and alone time.   There is only one front door so our paths will cross from time to time at least.",
    "interaction": "Always available for questions and recommendations.  Our busy schedules sometimes allow us more interaction but generally you will be left alone to explore.",
    "house_rules": "Simple! Be respectful and courteous of the space.   The building is pretty quiet and we aim to keep it that way -- no loud music or partying in the apt.  Plenty of places to do that outside in Williamsburg. No smoking in the apt.",

The Lower East Side is now one of Manhattan\u2019s most fashionable neighborhoods.

The Tenement Museum keeps the neighborhood\u2019s history alive in a series of restored apartments visited via themed guided tours, but most of the area\u2019s cultural draws are contemporary: The arrival of the New Museum on the Bowery several years ago drew numerous art galleries to the LES. Take a walk in the area south of Broome Street and east of Lafayette, and you\u2019ll be in Chinatown.

Love to entertain and show people the wonderment of Harlem and NYC.\r\nI love to travel and recently went on a yoga retreat to Roatan.  Read the Untethered Mind by Richard Smith as recommended before the retreat.  It was an awesome read. I am also a lover of everything entertaining!\r\nI am a fantastic hostess because I enjoy turning folks on to things most tourist would never see.  One Sunday as I was walking to church a French family asked me for directions to one of the popular churches near City University.  I talked them into coming to my church which has a fantastic a cappella choir and they had so much fun we all went to a jazz brunch afterwards where my good friend is the vocalist.  People often gravitate to my spirit which is always welcoming and receiving.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Historically, the Lower East Side was a stopping ground for immigrants who just arrived in NYC and was filled with tenements. There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.

    "notes": "This is my personal apartment. It's not a business. It's not a hotel. It's not perfect. I host often and keep up with my place because of that. I try to keep it as clean as possible.

    "transit": "F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park. It's the best train! :)",

A little farther, about a 10-12 minute walk, will get you to the A Train (or Blue Line) at the 181st Street Station (with an entrance on 184th Street). This train is the Express train and can get you to Times Square in only 20-25 minutes. My personal commute to 14th Street takes about 35 minutes door to door. There are also local private car services that we utilize and they will negotiate a price for you. We have their telephone numbers available for you. Taxis are more limited in this area, but here you will find the new GREEN taxis which service the outer-boroughs of Manhattan. However, the subway is by far the fastest and easiest mode of transportation to most locations.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "OUR HARLEM NEIGHBORHOOD: We love our neighborhood--I (Abby) first moved here in 2010 for grad school and it just keeps getting better! We are located in South Harlem - just 9 blocks from Central Park, in an area now affectionately being called \"SoHa\".  It's funky and diverse, with lots of history and character, and the streets are very broad and well-lit so it's easy and safe to walk around, even at night.  CAFES, BARS, RESTAURANTS: There are lots of shops, cafes, bakeries, bistros, wine bars, beer gardens, and night clubs all within a 10 block radius, and there's always something new to check out. HISTORIC HARLEM: We are surrounded by Harlem brownstones, gospel churches, and old jazz clubs. The Apollo Theater, Minton's Playhouse and Showman's all only a few blocks away. Also close by is the Studio Museum of Harlem, and Celebrity Chef Marcus Samuelsson's restaurant, Red Rooster. Make sure to check out our Neighborhood Guidebook to see all the nearby shops, bars, and restaurants! A SHOR",
    "notes": "We provide organic coffee and local teas. We are also able to provide breakfast, just let us know upon booking. If you have any questions or needs, please ask! We want your stay to meet or exceed your expectations. We do have a somewhat flexible check-in policy, but we also have full time jobs and may not be able to let you in during work hours (8-6 pm), or we may be able to arrange for you to get the key without meeting us. Please let us know your travel plans and we'll work hard to accommodate you and make your arrival smooth.",
    "transit": "Local trains (B, C) are 3 blocks away. Express trains (A, D) are 5 blocks away. We're also very close to the 2,3 trains at 116th. Trains to midtown are a quick 15 minute ride. Inexpensive public transportation from LaGuardia airport is extremely convenient here.",
    "access": "--Access to a well-stocked kitchen, dining room, and living room with Smart TV --Free Wifi and television streaming options (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime) --Bedding, towels, and hair dryer",
    "interaction": "We are available 24/7 to answer any questions or concerns you may have. We have plenty of recommendations for public transportation, restaurants, bars, entertainment, shopping, coffee shops, parks and more.",

I love languages and years ago spent some time abroad studying Spanish in Sevilla, Spain. \r\n\r\nI love to cook and entertain, and I enjoy running here in Central Park. I also love to read when I have time. In NY, I seek out good sample sales in the city. Feel free to ask me about them.\r\n\r\nEric, my husband, is a Texan who is a musician/philosopher/technical writer. He works at a software company but would probably rather be playing guitar or reading math books. He likes open spaces and mountain landscapes. \r\n\r\nWhen we spend time together in the city, we love to explore new neighborhoods on foot with our dog, Ike, or take bike rides along the Hudson River. We also like to listen to live music, especially jazz. \r\n\r\nWhen we travel, we try to pack light and hit the town. We like to take in a few things slowly, rather than trying to jam-pack a day.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Central Harlem is relaxed and spacious compared to rest of Manhattan.  Boulevards are wide and residents are friendly.  In recent years, many abandoned homes have been renovated (such as ours) and in response, new and exciting restaurants and shops seem to open every month.  Bed Bath&Beyond just opened a block away and Whole Foods Market is opening in the summer of 2017.  I have a list of local restaurant and store recommendations in the apartment.   Harlem is a gentrifying neighborhood.  It is not the Upper East Side, and we wouldn't want it to be.  Our family has been living here for two years, and many of our neighbors have been here for generations.  This block is lively in the summertime, and you should expect to see people gathering on the side walk enjoying music and conversation in the evenings.  Things generally quiet down after 11 pm.  Overall, the street noise here is typical for New York City.  In cooler weather, it is quieter that commercial streets. I am often asked if it",
    "notes": "No TV.  No Elevator.  Free wi-fi, tea, coffee and filtered water.  The convenience center is not a kitchen and does not have a sink or a stove.  It is intended for enjoying take-out, snacks and drinks.  Dishes and utensils are available.   Our townhouse is located on a beautiful residential block.  The amount of street noise is typical for New York City, but gets louder in the summer with the socializing on the stoops.  Please bring ear plugs if you are not used to it.",
    "transit": "This townhouse is easily accessible from all major points in Manhattan. Subways: The closest subway stop is right around the corner, a 3 min. walk away -- the 2/3 express stop at W. 125 St. and Lenox (or Malcolm X Blvd).  The 2/3 trains stop at the Upper West Side (Lincoln Center), Times Square (Broadway district), Penn Station, Chelsea, One World Trade Center, Wall Street, and Brooklyn.  A 15 min. walk to the west is the ABCD subway for Central Park West, The Natural History Museum, and Columbus Circle.  A 15 min. walk to the east is the 4/5/6 line for the Upper East Side, Grand Central, Union Square, and the East Village.   Buses: The M60 express bus stops on W. 125 St. at Lenox and goes to/from LaGuardia Airport.  The M102 bus stops on Lenox at W. 124 St. and travels to the Upper East Side, Central Park Zoo, and the Met and Guggenheim Museums on 5th Avenue.

We used to run thru the nightclubs and live the crazy lifestyle...we couldn't live without late night movies, the latest bar/lounge/club, being in \"THE IT\" crowd, running off to Paris or a quick trip to Vegas at a moments notice for a few days!  \r\n\r\nFunny, but we now get up at dawn and love to go to the Zoo, reading, although presently its all about Dr. Seuss's \"Hop on Pop\", and walking thru the city and exploring all the different neighborhoods.  We  enjoy going to ethnic restaurants and exploring tastes while exposing our girl to all NYC has to offer.  \r\n\r\nAs we are a mixed couple, living within this diverse city gives us a sense of home that we cherish.  We are a small family with a HUGE extended family that live in the New York and Maryland area and work hard developing our relationships with our family.  \r\n\r\nWhen we travel we appreciate a host that welcomes us like family, but stays out of our business.  Thats what you can expect from us.  We want to be available to you if you need, but otherwise, enjoy your privacy and have fun.  We believe that being a good person is crucial and that good things happen to good people.  That is what we are....good people.",

For when my travels take me far and wide, my best friend Alex is here at your service to greet you and take care of any needs that may arise. I am fun-loving and always enjoy a good game night (of which, I have many at the apartment for your enjoyment).",

Simply take the C train to the 163rd/Amsterdam stop and you're here! Rest assured however that because it's underground, the noise of the train is a non-issue.  For bus service, the stop around the corner provides access to the M3, M100, and M101 so if you're looking to stay above ground you're covered there as well!  If you're bringing a car, free parking all around our building is also incredibly convenient with \"street sweeping\" only happening once a week. We have learned all the tricks to parking so we will be happy to pass those along should you need. Getting here from the airports is fairly simple. LaGuardia is the closest, and is a 15-minute cab ride away (when there is no traffic). It should only cost about 35. With public transportation simply take the M60 Select Bus Service to 125th St/Frederick",
    "access": "As our guests, you have access to anything you need in the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. You'll get clean linens and basic amenities should you need them. In addition, password-protected Wi-Fi is accessible throughout the apartment. In the living room we have a flatscreen TV with Blu Ray, Apple TV, and HBO which you're welcome to use. We also have a nice selection of movies on hand as well as a large selection of exercise DVDs and equipment if you need to squeeze in a workout!  Our kitchen is large and includes a full-size refrigerator, gas stove/oven, microwave, french-press, blender and a vast array of kitchen supplies and utensils. It also boasts a table that is set up for 2 but which will expand to seat up to 4.  The bathroom is large and has plenty of space for toiletries. We have a shower/tub, with ample hot water and excellent water pressure. Towels and washcloths are provided. Overall, we want to take the worry out of your trip so anything we can provide, we will",
    "interaction": "Our schedule varies quite a bit, but rest assured that when we are at home, we love to get to know our guests! We encourage you to use the apartment like a roommate might. Sit and watch some Netflix with us and crack open a bottle of wine if you like. That being said, we know you're not coming to New York to see us, so please don't feel obligated to spend your valuable vacation time on us.",
    "house_rules": "Check in is after 3 pm (depending on our availability) and check out is by 11 am. If you need to leave luggage that is a possibility, just let us know and we will try our very best to accommodate you!  Common courtesy is our most important rule. We expect everyone, (including ourselves), to be mutually respectful of the common space. This includes cleaning up our own messes, washing our own dishes, and keeping the living room, kitchen, and bathroom tidy and comfortable. We expect our animals to be treated humanely, safely, and lovingly. We request that they not be fed human food, no matter how cute they are or how long Rusty gives you his heart-melting \"puppy dog\" eyes.  No smoking inside the apartment. Tobacco, or anything else... We love to meet people, but inviting guests of guests into our home is something we'd rather not do. We're sure your friends are awesome, but please respect our home and meet them for dinner and drinks down the street, not in the apartment.  In general, our",

Otherwise, I'm writing scripts, stories and drawing weird doodles. I love the arts so if I'm traveling to your city, its usually for the arts. \r\n\r\nI'm usually very chill and relaxed but love to travel. My first taste of AirBNB was while I was visiting friends in Europe--they used it and it made our trip to Paris so seamless. Thought I'd give it a try here in the US. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nRiley",

Soho is great for shopping, Chelsea has all the galleries, Williamsburg is full of hipsters, and the financial district is simply dead after 5 ^^ Greenwich Village or \u201cThe Village\u201d was traditionally the neighborhood of bohemians, poets and starving artists \u2026 back when Soho was still mostly warehouses ^^ \u2026 and it still has an amazing live-and-let-live, free spirit vibe. It\u2019s the neighborhood where tourists and New Yorkers go any day of the week to have a beer or grab dinner with friends.

And at night the Empire State Building\u2019s lights often have different colors :) The Village has a vibe of the old old New York, because",

I like going out with friends, doing many kinds of outdoor activities, meeting new people, trying good food, cooking excellent food:) and many other things. I travel quite a lot and always prefer airbnb over hotels. I love how airbnb connects people from all around the world and helps me enjoy different cities like a local. My apartment is in a great location where you can easily walk to all the cool places (restaurants, bars, designer boutiques, etc) in downtown and experience the city just like a true New Yorker. Enjoy!:)\r\n\r\nOh airbnb is asking for my life motto. My motto is \"Leave people better than you found them\". I truly believe there is good in everyone and we should never give up on being kind and loving towards each other. 3",
