I served 5 years in the Navy and did some deployments too. I'm fine, however! I just a never lost that sense of adventure. \n\nI've been to many states, many countries, and sailed many seas. I'm honest and respectful. I love walking about the city to take in the sights and eat as much as possible.\n\nBut i was born and raised in Houston Tx! Yup... I have cowboy boots and I can lasso. But I love the city of Houston! We are known for our quick wit and southern hospitality. The people I usually travel with are also from Houston! We love seeing new places and experiencing as much as possible. All my friends are good people doing the right things, so it's nice to break away from life and let loose! \n\nThanks! \nV",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Inwood is friendly, leafy-green, and community oriented. We have a wonderful Saturday Farmer's Market, the famous medieval museum at the Cloisters, views of the Hudson, and plenty of low key local bars and restaurants. You can also visit the spot where the island was first bought nearby. We call it Upstate Manhattan!",
    "notes": "This is a great location for parents or friends coming to visit students at Columbia or Fordham. Fordham is a 20 minute bus ride away on the Bx12, and Columbia is 20 minutes on the 1. My family loves being able to stay with me in Manhattan, and we all love the easy commute to school events. For the convenience and price it's a win-win.  Otherwise, the thing to note about Inwood is that it's 30 minutes to midtown and about 40 minutes all the way downtown, so if you're visiting NYC keep in mind that it's easy enough to get everywhere, but you won't be in and out of the house in between site-seeing destinations.  My apartment is an older building, and in all older buildings there are quirks. I have consistent hot water and decent water pressure, but sometimes the shower takes a while to calibrate. The furnaces are all working, but sometimes they make noise. If that is the kind of thing that will bother you a lot, this is probably not the right place for you to stay.",
    "transit": "There is lots of great public transit. My apartment is a half city block from the A train (runs down Broadway on the west side), 3 blocks from the 1 train (runs downs 8th avenue on the east side), several Manhattan buses downtown, and the Bronx 12 (Bx12) Select Service Bus into the Bronx.",

    "house_rules": "I'm pretty easy going. Just have basic respect for my things (i.e.,) don't break them, don't spill on them). To avoid that I would appreciate having no food or dark beverages in the bedroom. Beer/wine is okay- enjoy the city!",

I'm from Chicago originally, and I am loving plugging into the beat of a new city. I'm currently working on my Ph.D in philosophy, so that's an interest, but I also love to travel, eat, and read non-philosophy. My favorite form of exercise is Ashtanga Yoga, my favorite food is everything, my favorite night out is comedy and drinks, jazz, or wine classes. I also like to study languages, so I'm currently learning French for my degree, and I spent my undergraduate years learning Arabic and traveling in North Africa and in the Middle East. If only Arabic wasn't so hard, I might have gotten better at it!\r\n\r\nI hope to make sure that your stay is comfortable and that you have everything that you need. If you would like to stick around the neighborhood to get the Inwood experience, then I'm happy to show you around. But if you're doing your own thing, then by all means do NYC your way.\r\n\r\nps- I don't have a solo picture of me that's recent, so I'm the one in the middle of my profile picture! There I'm in France waiting to see some Bastille Day fireworks last summer.",

I'd describe myself as clean, considerate and easy going. I'd love to welcome anyone who share those qualities to stay at my apartment in the heart of east village while exploring New York City!",

I love the arts so if I'm traveling to your city, its usually for the arts. \r\n\r\nI'm usually very chill and relaxed but love to travel. My first taste of AirBNB was while I was visiting friends in Europe--they used it and it made our trip to Paris so seamless. Thought I'd give it a try here in the US. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nRiley",

Currently I do a little food writing and plan on becoming a food critic in the near future as I love to dine all over the city. \r\n I would say that I am a citizen of the world. I have been to over 20 countries and plan to reach my goal of 100 countries in the next 20 yrs. Wish me luck. Out of some of those countries I have resided for long periods of time in Belize, Central America; Mexico; and the Bahamas in the Caribbean. I hope to one day live in South East Asia, preferably Cambodia as they are big in the volunteerism industry. Actually for the last few years I have been residing in Belize volunteering and traveling throughout Central America. \r\n  I speak a few languages, which include French Spanish and obviously English. I'm really not so good at the second languages but I get by and I could probably hold a good intense 10 minute conversation before you tell me to just stop trying.. lol.\r\n  I am big on anthropology and love to meet new people and find out about they're cultures and experiences. I guess I would say that I am a big people person. I love the whole concept of Airbnb because it allows me to do what I love best... travel and socialize. As a host I understand what its like to visit new or even revisit interesting places and so I like to be as accommodating to my guest as much as possible.\r\n  I think that's pretty much it about me. Oh no wait, I also have a pretty good sense of humor.  \" knock knock\" ... \"who's there?\" ... \"you're airbnb guest!\" Ok maybe not so funny but I try.",

This train is the Express train and can get you to Times Square in only 20-25 minutes. My personal commute to 14th Street takes about 35 minutes door to door. There are also local private car services that we utilize and they will negotiate a price for you. We have their telephone numbers available for you.

However, I will ask airbnb to connect us. There is NO upfront security deposit required. In the unlikely case there is damage or other costs, the amount of the damage is deducted by airbnb after you leave. However over the years, there has never been any charge like this.",

I love music, film, art, interior design, and other cultures. It's been lovely meeting wonderful people from around the world here on airbnb. \r\n\r\nI should mention that I've noticed that the apt. is most loved by young, intellectual, or artist guests, who appreciate the edgy charm of this old, tenement apartment, and are willing to adapt to NY living. \r\n\r\nPhoto: My hair is long now, I need to update the photo.",

We used to run thru the nightclubs and live the crazy lifestyle...we couldn't live without late night movies, the latest bar/lounge/club, being in \"THE IT\" crowd, running off to Paris or a quick trip to Vegas at a moments notice for a few days!  \r\n\r\nFunny, but we now get up at dawn and love to go to the Zoo, reading, although presently its all about Dr. Seuss's \"Hop on Pop\", and walking thru the city and exploring all the different neighborhoods.  We  enjoy going to ethnic restaurants and exploring tastes while exposing our girl to all NYC has to offer.  \r\n\r\nAs we are a mixed couple, living within this diverse city gives us a sense of home that we cherish.  We are a small family with a HUGE extended family that live in the New York and Maryland area and work hard developing our relationships with our family.  \r\n\r\nWhen we travel we appreciate a host that welcomes us like family, but stays out of our business.  Thats what you can expect from us.  We want to be available to you if you need, but otherwise, enjoy your privacy and have fun.  We believe that being a good person is crucial and that good things happen to good people.  That is what we are....good people.",

I'm a people person and enjoy meeting new people from different countries. If we meet and you speak a different language, I will probably  be asking you how to say something in your language.\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you and will do whatever I can to make your stay in NY enjoyable.",

I went to college at FSU and was first a Music Performance Major (French Horn), but later switched to a Fashion Merchandising Major which is what I hold my bachelor's degree in. \r\n\r\nI have recently just relocated to New York City and currently reside in the Upper East Side. I work for a luxury jewelry company on Fifth Avenue. \r\n\r\nI am currently single and will most likely be traveling alone, at most with a friend. I am fairly shy and quiet at first but tend to open up fairly quickly. I don't go out to bars much, but love a good restaurant and will be on my priority list of things to do when am in your city. Am also a huge music and movie buff. \r\n\r\nNow that I am turning 30 this year I have decided to do more traveling and find that Airbnb might be the most affordable way to go places I have yet to see. I have never used this before but I am excited to try this out and hope it all works out.",

    "neighborhood_overview": "Aside from being located in a historic neighborhood, this area is a virtual hotbed of new activity! Because of its central location, new restaurants are opening all of the time, and the nightlife is picking up considerably.  The Ace Hotel is a block away, with the NoMad Hotel at the end of the block. Fairway Supermarket is 4 blocks away as well as the famed Eataly, and, if you love to shop, 5th Avenue shopping is down the street in the Flatiron district, as well as Macy's and Herald Square shopping in the opposite direction. Even Times Square is just a short subway ride (2 stops) or 20-minute walk away. You can stroll through Madison Square Square Park to view the lovely art installations or just people watch ... or head on over to the Highline to get a bird's eye view of the city landscape.  We're moving on up here!",
